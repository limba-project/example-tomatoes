.SH NAME
tomatoes \- Tomatoes smashing game
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtomatoes\fR

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fBI Have No Tomatoes\fR is an extreme leisure time activity idea of which
culminates in the following question: How many tomatoes can you smash in
ten short minutes? If you have the time to spare, this game has the
vegetables just waiting to be eliminated!
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Before starting the game, you should know that the game uses OpenGL for
hardware accelerated 2d & 3d graphics. This means that you must have fully
OpenGL compatible graphics card in your PC. Your card also needs to be able
to use 512x512 textures, and this rules out Voodoo 1, 2 and 3 (limited to
256x256 textures).
.PP
As for the CPU and memory requirements, I'd recommend something along the
lines of Pentium II (or an AMD equivalent) and 64MB. The game works on much
slower systems as well, as the game skips frames if the system can't keep up
with the 60 FPS rate; this ensures that the game runs at the right speed, you
just don't get very smooth animation.
.PP
This game features solid game play with beautiful OpenGL API driven isometric
3d graphics and nice music. It also includes a MOD player, and you can use
your own MOD-type music in the game background. Just copy your
XM/S3M/IT/MOD - files to the \fImusic\fR subdirectory of \fBI Have No Tomatoes\fR
and the game plays them. You can press \fBF1\fR to skip a song when ingame. There's
room for 128 MODs. Btw, if you don't have any MOD music, ModArchive
(www.modarchive.com <URL:www.modarchive.com>) is a good place to download some.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
You may also want to set some options, such as the screen resolution and
color depth. By default, \fBI Have No Tomatoes\fR starts fullscreen in 800x600
resolution, 32bpp. To fine-tune the preferences to suit your PC better, open
the file \fIconfig.cfg\fR in a text editor (Notepad will do). Under
Unix this file is stored in \fI~/.tomatoes/\fR\&.
.PP
Most likely you'll be interested in these lines:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBvideo_mode\fR = 800 x 600
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBvideo_mode_color_depth\fR = 32
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBvideo_mode_fullscreen\fR = 1
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBsound_enabled\fR = 1
.PP
To set the resolution, change the \fBvideo_mode\fR - line (some common
resolutions include 640 x 480, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768). Most common color
depths are 16 and 32, and sometimes 24. \fBvideo_mode_fullscreen\fR controls
whether the game starts in fullscreen or in a window. When running in
windowed mode, you can use any resolution you want (the 4:3 aspect ratio
modes are still preferred). If you don't have a sound card (or want to turn
the sounds off), set \fBsound_enabled\fR to 0 (zero).
.PP
Finally, if you want to know how many frames your system draws per second
(FPS), set \fBshow_fps\fR to 1. FPS should be over 60 for smooth animation.
.PP
The default keys can be changed from the Options menu in game, so no need
change them here.
.PP
When you're satisfied with the \fIconfig.cfg\fR settings, by all means, proceed
to start the game :)
